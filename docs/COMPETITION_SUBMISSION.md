## Executive Summary

KrishiRakshak is an **Edge AI-based agricultural monitoring system** that leverages Silicon Labs' EFR32MG26 and SiWx917 SoCs to deliver real-time crop health insights to Indian farmers. Our solution addresses critical challenges in agriculture through low-power, offline-first edge intelligence that detects crop stress, pest infestations, and water deficiencies **48-72 hours before visible symptoms appear**.

### Key Differentiators
- **MVP-Accelerated Inference:** 0.01ms decision time using Matrix Vector Processor
- **Multi-modal Sensing:** Environmental + acoustic data fusion for higher accuracy
- **True Edge Operation:** Zero cloud dependency for core functionality
- **Solar-Powered:** Months of autonomous field operation
